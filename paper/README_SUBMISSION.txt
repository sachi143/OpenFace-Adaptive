# Submission Guide: FG 2026 & TAFFC

## 1. The Research Packet
Your `paper_draft` folder now contains:
*   `FG_2026_Submission.md`: The master paper draft. **Edit this file.**
*   `novelty_arguments.md`: Your "defense" against reviewers. Copy sections from here into the "Introduction" or "Related Work" of the master draft if you need more padding.
*   `figures_and_tables.md`: The raw data for your tables and figure captions.

## 2. Immediate Action (FG 2026)
**URGENT: Abstract Deadline is Jan 9, 2026 (Days Away!)**
**Paper Deadline: Jan 15, 2026**

1.  **Double-Blind Rule**: Do NOT include your name or affiliation in the PDF. The draft is now marked `[ANONYMIZED]`. Keep it that way.
2.  **Submit Abstract NOW**: Go to [fg2026.ieee-biometrics.org](https://fg2026.ieee-biometrics.org) and register your paper title/abstract by Jan 9.
3.  **Page Limit**: Target **8 pages** (excluding references).

## 3. The "Backup" Plan (IEEE TAFFC)
If you miss the FG deadline:
1.  Expand the "Experiments" section using the `results/` logs.
2.  Add the `plot_trust.py` figure as "Figure 3: Explainability".
3.  Submit to *IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing* (Rolling Deadline).

## 4. Final Verification
*   **Accuracy**: 78.9% (Verified in `results.txt`).
*   **Model Size**: 2.5 MB (Verified by `quantize.py`).
*   **Citations**: 7 Key References included (2018-2025).

**Good Luck!**
